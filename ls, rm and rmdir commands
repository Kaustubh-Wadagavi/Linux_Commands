Delete Files And Directories(rm and rmdir)-
1. rmdir can only be used to remove an empty directory. It won't work for non-empty directories. 
2. rm removes both files and non-empty directories. 
3. Performed commands-
A. rmdir Directory - this command removed an empty folder named Directory.
B. rm Demo.txt - This command removed the txt file.
The drawback of rm command is if we use this command on any file or directory after deleting we can't recycle it(can't go in the trash), which means this command deletes file and directory permanently.
