**Executing commands on the output of another command (xargs)**
1. Xargs is a command that reads streams of data from standard input, then generates and executes command lines; meaning it can take the output of a command and passes it as argument of another command. 
2. If no command is specified, xargs executes echo by default. We can also instruct it to read data from a file instead of stdin.
Performed Commands:
a. $ find Pictures/tecmint/ -name "* .png" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 tar -cvzf images.tar.gz
b. $ ls -1 Pictures/tecmint/
c. $ ls -1 Pictures/tecmint/ | xargs
d. $ cut -d: -f1 < /etc/passwd | sort | xargs
e. $ ls *upload* | xargs wc
f. $ find Downloads -name "DomTerm" -type d -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -v -rf "{}"
3. we can instruct xargs to read items from a file instead of standard input using the -a flag 
e.g $ xargs -a rss_links.txt
4. We can get more information, read the xargs man page using $ man xargs.

**Search Files (Find)-**
1. Find command is used to search and locate the list of files and directories based on conditions you specify for files that match the arguments.
