Linux Level 1 Proficiency
1. Who created Linux?
Ans â€“ Linux, Computer Operating System created by Finish software engineer Linus Torvalds 
and the Free Software Foundation(FSF) in 1990. Linux Operating System is similar to MINIX, a UNIX Operating System.

2. What is Open-Sorce?
Ans- Open source means any computer software that's distributed with its source code available for modification. 
That means it usually includes a license for programmers to change the software in any way they choose, 
They can fix bugs, improve functions, or adapt the software to suit their own needs.

3. How is Linux developed and maintained?
Ans- Linux is opensource. Linux is built collaboratively across companies, geographies, and markets. 
Linux has a huge community of more than 10000 developers and 1000 companies, helping to move towards the future. 
By using Linux windows and android phones are developed. Also, Google, Facebook, and Twitter-like companies use Linux. 
A new kernel comes out every 2-3 months. This sort of speed is achieved by employing a unique collaborative developing technique. 
This technique has made Linux as the biggest collaborative development product.

4. And anything else you can discover about Linux history.
Ans- The resulting Linux Kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history. 
Since the initial release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from a small number of C files under 
a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 with more than 23.3 million lines of source code, 
not counting comments, under the GNU General Public License v2.

5. Why there are so many flavors in Linux?
Ans- The reason why there are so many Linux flavors out there is,
 because that unlike Windows and macOS, Linux is not a live with what you get one fits all operating system.
 Linux is an operating system core or kernel with a modular build around it. Hence, Linux has so many Flavours.

6. What is the difference between each flavor?
Ans- The differences between flavors are in the particulars of what a flavor is designed to accomplish, 
which versions of what tools it includes to achieve that goal, and how it chooses to handle configuration and packaging.
A flavor aimed at desktop users typically includes the X-window system, a desktop environment, a printing subsystem, networking components, etc. 
One designed for servers often doesn't include X or a desktop environment but adds services that aren't needed on a desktop (webserver, database, network filesystems, etc).
