Search files for strings/words (grep, egrep, fgrep)
grep-
1. The grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters and displays all lines that contain that pattern. The fgrep filter searches for fixed-character strings in a file or files.
2. grep can be used to search string within a file. 
3. Performed Commands
A. grep linux * 
B. grep -i linux * - to ignore case we need to use grep with combination of -i
C. grep -inh --colour=auto linux * - grep option -h allows us to suppress to display the file name and with -n option grep numbers lines within a file. --colour=auto highlights match
D. grep -iv linux * -If we do not want grep to output lines which does not contain lines with keyword linux we use -v ( invert )
E. grep -icv linux *  -With -c grep can count string occurrences within files, so here the grep will print number of how many times keyword linux does NOT appear within both files.
F. grep -l Ubuntu * -If we are looking for the name of the file which contains keyword "Ubuntu" we would use grep's -l option
G. grep -ixc linux * -Grep with -x option will print exact occurrences only.

egrep-
1. egrep is an extended version of grep or egrep is equal to grep -E. 
2. Egrep supports more regular expression patterns.
3. Performed Commands-
A. Search for lines which contains exactly two consecutive p characters
egrep p{2} *
OR
grep pp *
OR
grep -E p{2} * 
2. Get the output of egrep command with all lines which ends with "S" OR "A" :
egrep "S$|A$" * 

fgrep-
1. fgrep is a faster version of grep which does not support regular expressions and therefore is considered to be faster. fgrep is equal to grep -F.
2. fgrep does not interpret regular expressions (regex)
fgrep linux$ *
egrep linux$ *
grep linux$ * 

rgrep-
rgrep is a recursive version of grep. Recursive in this case means that rgrep can recursively descend through directories as it greps for the specified pattern. rgrep is similar to grep -r.
mkdir -p dir/dir1
echo "Linux_rgrep" > dir/dir1/rgrep.txt
grep rgrep *
rgrep rgrep *
grep -r rgrep *
