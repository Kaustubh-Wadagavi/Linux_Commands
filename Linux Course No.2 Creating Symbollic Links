    Working with Links in Linux 
A.Create a symbolic Soft Link-
1. For creating symbollic link we have to choose one Directory.
2. After we to use the command ln-s name of file [name of file].
3.After this we have to check it by using ls -al.
4.for reading file content we have to use the command cat [filename].
5.To check the inode number for link then we have to use the command ls -i.

B.Create a Hard Link-
1.To create hard link we we have to choose one directory.
2.After we have to use ln command and file name.
3.To check the link we have to use command ls -al.
4.An then use command cat to check both are same.
5.To check inode number we have to use ls -i.

If we want to create a soft link across file system then we have to use -s flag.

The file and link have different inodes.But, the linking will work.
